The Interests column appears to contain lists of interests, which will need to be unpacked for further analysis. We will begin by splitting the interests into individual rows and then exploring the most common interests. Given that the data is already in a CSV format, we can treat it as a SQL table and proceed with the analysis using SQL queries.
Python
import pandas as pd

pd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)

# Read the CSV file into a DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('SocialMediaUsersDataset (1).csv')

# Display the first 5 rows
print(df.head().to_markdown(index=False, numalign="left", stralign="left"))

# Print the column names and their data types
print(df.info())

The data appears to be in a suitable format for our analysis. The Interests column is of type Object, which aligns with our observation that it contains lists of interests.
Given that the Interests column contains values such as "'Movies', 'Fashion', 'Fashion', 'Books'", we will need to remove the single quotes and split these into individual interests. We can then proceed with counting the occurrences of each interest and identifying the most frequent ones.
Python
# Remove single quotes and split the `Interests` column into a list
df['Interests'] = df['Interests'].astype(str).str.replace(r"'", '', regex=True).str.split(', ')

# Explode the list of interests into individual rows
exploded_df = df.explode('Interests')

# Count the occurrences of each unique interest
interest_counts = exploded_df['Interests'].value_counts()

# Display the top 10 interests
print("Top 10 Interests:")
print(interest_counts.head(10).to_markdown(numalign="left", stralign="left"))

Code output
Top 10 Interests:
| Interests            | count   |

| Fashion              | 20077   |

Difficulties
The dataset is relatively straightforward, with no missing values. However, the Interests column presented a challenge as it contained lists of interests, which needed to be unpacked for further analysis.
Interesting Observation
One interesting aspect of the dataset is the global distribution of users. The dataset includes users from various countries, suggesting a diverse user base for the social media platform.
Cool Facts
The most popular interest among users is 'Fashion', followed by 'Pets' and 'Cooking'.
The distribution of interests is quite even across the top categories, with 'Fashion' being the only standout.
Questions and Answers
Table 1: Top 10 Interests
SELECT Interests, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM SocialMediaUsers
GROUP BY Interests
ORDER BY count DESC
LIMIT 10;

Table 2: Top 3 Interests in Each Country (Sample)
SELECT Country, Interests, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM SocialMediaUsers
WHERE Country IN ('Indonesia', 'Libya', 'Jordan', 'Italy', 'Venezuela') 
GROUP BY Country, Interests
ORDER BY Country, count DESC;

Table 3: Average Interests per Gender
SELECT Gender, AVG(num_interests) AS avg_interests
FROM (
  SELECT UserID, Gender, COUNT(Interests) AS num_interests
  FROM SocialMediaUsers
  GROUP BY UserID, Gender
) AS subquery
GROUP BY Gender;

mportant Considerations
Table Name: In the queries above, I've used SocialMediaUsers as the table name. You'll need to replace this with the actual name of your table.
Exploding Interests: The original dataset had a list of interests in each row. For these SQL queries to work, you would need to have a table where each interest is on a separate row for each user (like the exploded_df in the Python code).
Data Types: Make sure your SQL database correctly represents the data types of the columns (e.g., Interests as text).
